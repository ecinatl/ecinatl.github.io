She made difficult concepts easy to understand and she instilled confidence in place of doubt and uncertainty.   Emma was one of the best professors I have ever had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma was very, very good at putting things into common day language so you could understand it. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Math isn’t usually my thing but Emma helped to make it a breeze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The instructor could not have been more personable or organized. She has been more than helpful and accessible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The instructor was very organized and made it clear what we were expected to know and had a schedule for all of our due dates.  She also gave us plenty of resources to ask questions and get help for the course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would highly recommend this instructor. She was friendly, helpful, responsive, personable, and very knowledgeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma is an awesome person and teacher.  She was well organized, very smart and knows the material by heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma was a fantastic teacher.  Super friendly, helpful, and understanding.  Would help with even the smallest problems, and really wanted you to succeed, giving us many opportunities to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma has been the best math teacher that I have had in a while. I have loved the one-on-one experience and in depth help with understanding topics as well as just having good conversation with Emma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma was my favorite teacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma Cinatl was very helpful and understood where students were coming from whenever they had problems. As a busy graduate student, it was clear she was very busy working on other things, but despite this, she was more than willing to make time for the students in our class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma is one of the best math teachers I have ever had.  She gave up so much of her time to make sure we understood the material and never made us feel stupid about it.  She made me feel so comfortable in class and I always get nervous in classes.  Emma knew what she was talking about and tried so hard to help us all to succeed.  She cared about what she was doing and cared about us so much that is showed everyday.  Emma would be my first pick of a teacher for any class. I freaking love her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loved how Emma taught.  She was fun and engaged with her students and really cared about how they were doing in the class. She really wanted to see us succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;*Instructor covered all topics necessary to do well on exams*Homework graded fairly and feedback helped to improve comprehension of course material&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She made learning business calc so easy, and understandable.  I couldn’t recommend her highly enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma was very accessible. She walked through examples step by step. This is exactly what needs to be done in order to strengthen understanding of concepts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emma is a super friendly teacher.  She is very clear when explaining things, and I like that she writes everything she says on the board.  She is also very nice about answering questions and re-explaining things without making anyone feel stupid.&rdquo;</p>
